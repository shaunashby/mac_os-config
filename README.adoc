== Requirements

. link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os[macOS]

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os-config.git
cd mac_os-config
git checkout 15.4.0
----

== Usage

The following will walk you through the steps of installing/re-installing your machine.

=== Pre-Install

Double check you have the following in place:

[arabic]
. A recent backup of your machine and a copy of your credentials to restore the backup.
. A copy of your of your Apple, backup server, and backup volume credentials.
. Xcode installed as per macOS requirements.

=== Install

See the link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os#_usage[macOS] project for usage as it
provides the command line interface for running the configuration defined by this project.

=== Post-Install

The following are additional steps, not easily automated, that are worth completing after the
install scripts have been executed:

* System Preferences:
** Security & Privacy:
*** General:
**** Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins.
**** Enable message when screen is locked. Example: `+<url> | <email> | <phone>+`.
**** Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac.
*** FileVault:
**** Enable FileVault and save the recovery key in a secure location (i.e. 1Password).
*** Firewall:
**** Enabled it.
**** Automatically allow signed software.
**** Enable stealth mode.
*** Privacy:
**** Apps like Dash, Dropbox, etc. will need to be enabled for accessibility.
** Notifications:
*** Enable _Do Not Disturb_ from 9pm to 7am.
*** Enable _When display is sleeping._
*** Enable _When mirroring._
*** Enable allow repeated calls.
*** Disable _Show notifications on lock screen_ for all apps.
*** Disable _Play sounds for notifications_ for all apps.
*** Configure all calendar apps to show banners instead of alerts for notifications.
** Printers & Scanners:
*** Add printer/scanner.
** iCloud:
*** Enable Find My Mac.
** Internet Accounts:
*** Add all accounts used by Mail.
** Network:
*** Configure Wi-Fi.
** Users & Groups:
*** Update avatar.
*** Remove unused login items.
*** Disable guest account.
* iStat Menus (double click, within the Applications folder, to install as a system preference).
* Hazel (double click, within the Applications folder, to install as a system preference).

=== Keyboard Shortcuts

Several applications provide global hotkey support. These are the associations I use (which are also
captured in the `+restore.bom+` as well):

* *COMMAND + SPACE (hold):* Siri (open)
* *COMMAND + SPACE:* Spotlight (open)
* link:https://www.alchemists.io/articles/clean_shot/#_shortcuts[CleanShot] - See article for
  details.
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + b:* Bartender (hidden menu toggle)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + ENTER:* Keymou (move cursor by division)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + k:* Keymou (cursor highlight show/hide)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + m:* Moom (show/hide)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + n:* Notification Center (show/hide)
* link:https://www.alchemists.io/articles/pixel_snap/#_shortcuts[PixelSnap] - See article for
  details.
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + r:* Resolutionator (selector)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + ←:* Keymou (move cursor left)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + ↑:* Keymou (move cursor up)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + →:* Keymou (move cursor right)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + ↓:* Keymou (move cursor down)
* *CONTROL + OPTION + SPACE:* OmniFocus (quick entry)
* *OPTION + SPACE:* Alfred (open)

=== Newsyslog

Native to macOS, link:https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?newsyslog.conf(5)[newsyslog] can be used
to configure system-wide log rotation across multiple projects. It’s a good recommendation to set
this up so that disk space is carefully maintained. Here’s how to configure it for your system,
start by creating a configuration for your projects in the `+/etc/newsyslog.d+` directory. In my
case, I use the following configurations:

* `+/etc/newsyslog.d/alchemists.conf+`
+
....
  # logfilename                                            [owner:group]    mode   count   size  when  flags
  /Users/bkuhlmann/Dropbox/Development/Work/**/log/*.log                    644    2       5120  *     GJN
....
* `+/etc/newsyslog.d/homebrew.conf+`
+
....
  # logfilename                   [owner:group]    mode   count   size    when  flags
  /usr/local/var/log/**/*.log                      644    2       5120    *     GJN
....

These configurations ensure that logs are rotated every 5MB (5120KB). In order to test that these
configurations are valid, run:

....
sudo newsyslog -nvv
....

If you don’t see any errors in the output, then your configuration settings are correct.

The last thing to do is to add a launch configuration to ensure the log rotations happen at
regularly scheduled intervals. To do this create the following file:
`+$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.newsyslog.plist+`. It should have the following content:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "https://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.apple.newsyslog</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/sbin/newsyslog</string>
  </array>
  <key>LowPriorityIO</key>
  <true/>
  <key>Nice</key>
  <integer>1</integer>
  <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
  <dict>
    <key>Minute</key>
    <integer>30</integer>
  </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
----

That’s it. System-wide log rotation is setup for your projects.

=== Customization

While this project’s configuration is opinionated and tailored for my setup, you can easily fork
this project and customize it for your environment. Start by editing the files found in the `+bin+`
and `+lib+` directories. Here is a breakdown of each:

* `bin/apply_basic_settings`: Applies basic and initial settings for setting up a machine.
* `bin/apply_default_settings`: Applies useful system and application defaults.
* `bin/install_app_store`: Installs macOS, GUI-based, App Store applications.
* `bin/install_applications`: Installs macOS, GUI-based, non-App Store applications.
* `bin/install_extensions`: Installs macOS application extensions and add-ons.
* `bin/install_homebrew_casks`: Installs Homebrew Casks.
* `bin/install_homebrew_formulas`: Installs Homebrew Formulas.
* `bin/restore_backup`: Restores system/application settings from backup image.
* `bin/setup_software`: Configures and launches (if necessary) installed software.
* `lib/settings.sh`: Defines custom settings for software applications, extensions, etc.

_TIP_: The installer determines which applications/extensions to install as defined in the
`+settings.sh+` script. Applications defined with the "`APP_NAME`" suffix and extensions defined
with the "`EXTENSION_PATH`" suffix inform the installer what to care about. Removing/commenting out
these applications/extensions within the `+settings.sh+` file will cause the installer to skip these
applications/extensions.
